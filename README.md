# Twitter_webscrapping
How do people extract data from website? Copy-Paste is excel? Would you do that for 1000 web pages of a site, no right? Here, web scrapping with a few lines of code comes into play!
In this project, I have taken some random 1000 tweets in which people were asking for help and filtered out those which were completely ignored(0 likes and 0 retweets) and saved those records on a .csv file on my computer.
